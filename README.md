# TAGET user manual

TAGET is a computational toolkit that provides a wide spectrum of tools for analyzing full-length transcriptome data. Based on its highly precise transcript alignment and junction prediction, TAGET enables accurate novel isoform, gene fusion detection, and expression quantification analyses

## Environmental dependence

 * samtools
 * python3
 * R>=3.3
 * Linux cento OS
 * Python packages:rpy2,pandas,numpy
 * R packages:stringr,optparse,DEGseq

## FAST RUN

	python TransAnnot.py -f [fasta] -g [genome fasta] -o [output directory] -a[annot gtf] -p [process] --use_minimap2 [1] --use_hisat2 [hisat2 index]
	
	or you can use
	
	python TransAnnot.py -c TransAnnot.Config
## Running time
The running time is about less than 1 hours with 8 core on a Linux server

## software running
1.the config file contain environmental path of each software and the index file of the reference genome 


2. you can set the following parameters at the first time
	* the path of HISAT2/Minimap2
	* the index file of reference genome
	* reference genome(FASTA)、anotiation of transcript file default Ensemble（GTF）、process number

3. After setting the base parameters,you can set the fasta file of the full length transcript and the output dictionary or you can use `-c config` and `-f [fatsa] -o [output]`
4. The reads\transcript\gene expression can be caculated by the parameter of --tpm

## TransAnnotMerge


We can use TransAnnotMerge to generate expression matrix of multi-samples

### FAST RUN
 extract isoform expression from fasta file：
 `python fa2exp.py -f [fa] -i [prefix] -o [exp] -p [taget output dictionary]`
 
 
 * `-f`: full length transcript fasta format file
 * `-o`: output dictionary
 * `-p`: prefix of {sample_uniqe_name}.anno files
 
`python script.py input.config`

This step needs to use exon.gtf file,which can be unzipped by using unzip exon.gtf.zip
### Usage of TransAnnotMerge

`python TranAnnotMerge -c MergeConfig -o outputdir -m [TPM/FLC/None]`




* `-c`： Merge Config，consist of four coloumn,sample ID() ，[{sample_id}.annot.stat]()，[{sample_id}.annot.bed]()，[{sample_id}.annot.db.pickle]()。

| #sample | stat | bed | db |
| ------- | ---- | --- | -- |
| ------- | ---- | --- | -- |

* `-o`: the output dictionary
* `-m`：the gene and transcript expression displayed by different methods,FLC: full length count，if none is not expression matrix

### TransAnnotMerge running
